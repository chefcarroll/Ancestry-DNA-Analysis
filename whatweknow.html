      Ethnicity Estimates</h1>
    <h2>Ancestry DNA tests can provide estimates of the percentage 
        of an individual's DNA that likely comes from different
         regions or populations around the world.</h2>

         <h1>Genetic Relatives</h1>
         <h2>Some tests also identify individuals who share genetic similarities, 
            suggesting a potential familial relationship.</h2>

            <h1>Migration Patterns</h1>
            <h2>By analyzing the distribution of specific genetic markers, 
                it may be possible to infer migration patterns of human populations over time. Results
            are based off of people who have had their genos sequenced. 80-90% 
        of results are of European descent. Barely and indigenous peoples are 
    represented at all in results from the database. The test won't show the heritages of people
who are not in the databases, which results in lost information that as of today is undiscoverable.</h2>
  
            <h1>DNA Matches</h1>
            <h2>Ancestry databases allow individuals to connect with others who share genetic similarities, 
                potentially indicating shared ancestors. </h2>

                <h1>Types of Ancestry DNA Tests</h1>
                <h2>There are three main types of DNA tests:

Autosomal DNA Tests (SNP Testing): These tests evaluate many individual variations (called single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs) across an individual’s genome. </h2>
<h1>.</h1>
<h2>Y-DNA tests (traces the direct line from fathers): These tests explore ancestry in the direct male line.</h2>
<h1>.</h1>
<h2>mtDNA tests (traces the direct line from mothers): Identifies genetic variations in the mitochondrial DNA.</h2>

                <h1>Similarities between Other Species found in DNA test results</h1>

                <h2>It is possible to get results back that prove your relations to other species.
                    For example, you may get a result that claims you are a small percentage of a Neanderthal.
                    This result does not come from the 99% of our genos shared between humans, but instead by
                    the 1% that varies. This is due to the fact that around 40,000 humna populations interbread with
                    Neanderthals.
                </h2>

                    <h1>.</h1>

            <h2>Through comparisons with extensive reference databases, scientists can infer ancient migration
                 patterns and the distribution of genetic markers across populations. This allows individuals
                  to receive ethnicity estimates, breaking down their genetic heritage into percentages 
                  associated with different regions or groups. While ancestry DNA analysis illuminates the
                   ancient roots of human populations and highlights the interconnectedness of global heritage,
                    it's important to note that these tests focus on genetic ancestry and do not provide a
                     detailed historical or cultural narrative of human development, which requires 
                     complementary insights from fields such as archaeology, anthropology, and historical
                      research.</h2>

                      <h1>Genotype & Phenotype</h1>
                      <h2>Most traits are influenced by many genes—some of which we don’t even know about yet. 
                        And environmental factors can affect your traits, too. Your set of genes is called your genotype,
                         and the expression of those genes is called your phenotype.The genotype is often expressed as a combination of alleles for 
                         a particular gene. For example, if a gene has two alleles, one inherited from each parent, 
                         the genotype could be homozygous (two identical alleles) or heterozygous (two different alleles).
                         The genotype plays a significant role in determining the phenotype. The combination of alleles and how they interact influences the traits that are expressed.
                         External factors, such as nutrition, temperature, and other environmental conditions, can also impact the phenotype. Some traits result from the interplay between genes and the environment.
                        <h1>.</h1>
                        <h2>Genotype Example: Consider a gene for eye color. If an individual inherits two alleles for brown eyes (B/B), their genotype for that gene is homozygous for brown eyes.</h2>
                        <h1>.</h1>
                        <h2>Phenotype Example: The observable eye color, which is brown in this case, represents the phenotype. </h2>
                      
                      
                      <h1>.</h1>


                <h1>What Ancestry DNA Analysis Can't Tell Us</h1>

                <h1>Personal Identity</h1>
                <h2>Ancestry DNA tests are not designed for personal identification purposes. They won't reveal unique personal details like your name or address.</h2>

    <h1>Detailed Genealogy</h1>

    <h2>While DNA tests can provide general information about ethnic origins, they don't offer a comprehensive family tree. Building a detailed genealogy requires additional research and records.</h2>

<h1>Recent Ancestry</h1>
<h2>Ancestry DNA tests provide information about ancient and more recent ancestral origins, but they don't specify recent generations or immediate family relationships.
    While DNA analysis can provide information about genetic ancestry, it may not offer precise details about cultural or historical aspects of a person's lineage. 
    It provides a broad overview of genetic markers associated with different populations.</h2>

<h1>Health Information (without specific tests)</h1>

<h2>Most ancestry tests focus on heritage and do not provide comprehensive health information. If you're interested in health-related genetic data, additional testing from companies specializing in health analysis is necessary.</h2>

<h1>.</h1>

<h2>While these tests offer valuable insights into broad ancestral origins and potential migration
     patterns, they cannot provide specific details about recent family members, individual
      identities, or detailed genealogies. Furthermore, ancestry DNA tests are distinct from
       comprehensive health assessments, as they prioritize heritage over health-related genetic
        information. As the field continues to advance, it's essential to recognize the evolving 
        nature of genetic ancestry testing and its limitations in offering a complete narrative of 
        personal origins. </h2>

        <h1>Our relationship with other Primates</h1>
        <h2>Due to billions of years of evolution, humans share genes with all living organisms. The percentage of genes or DNA that organisms share records their similarities.
             We share more genes with organisms that are more closely related to us. Humans belong to the biological group known as Primates, and are classified with the great apes, one of the major groups of the primate evolutionary tree. Besides similarities in anatomy and behavior, our close biological kinship with other primate species is indicated by DNA evidence. It confirms that our closest living biological relatives are chimpanzees and bonobos, with whom we share many traits. But we did not evolve directly from any primates living today.
             DNA also shows that our species and chimpanzees diverged from a common ancestor species that lived between 8 and 6 million years ago. The last common ancestor of monkeys and apes lived about 25 million years ago.
            </h2>
            <h1>.</h1>

            <h2>Shared Ancestry: Humans, chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and other primates share a common evolutionary ancestor. The divergence between the human and chimpanzee lineages is estimated to have occurred around 6-8 million years ago.
                The genetic code, which is the sequence of nucleotides in DNA that encodes genetic information, is highly conserved among primates. The similarity in the genetic code reflects our shared evolutionary history.
            </h2>
            <h1>.</h1>
<h2>Genetic Differences: While humans and primates share a significant portion of their genomes, there are also notable differences. 
    These differences include variations in the number and structure of chromosomes and specific genetic sequences.
    Humans have genes that are not found in other primates, and vice versa. Some of these unique genes may play a role in the development
     of traits that distinguish humans from other primates.</h2>
            <h1>.</h1>

            <h2>Accelerated Evolution: Certain genes in the human lineage have undergone accelerated evolution, contributing to the development of distinctive human traits. These changes are believed to be related to adaptations and innovations in areas such as brain development, language, and immune response.</h2>
            <h1>.</h1>

            <h2>Positive Selection: Positive selection refers to the process by which beneficial genetic variations become more prevalent in a population over time. Some genes associated with human adaptations, such as those related to bipedalism and brain development, have experienced positive selection.</h2>
<h1>.</h1>
<h2>Although humans and other primates share a common genetic heritage, evolutionary processes have led to both shared features and unique characteristics. Comparative genomics continues to be a valuable tool for understanding the genetic basis of human evolution and the traits that make us distinct within the primate order.
